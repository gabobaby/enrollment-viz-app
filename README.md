# School Enrollment Comparison App

This Streamlit app allows users to compare the enrollment data of elementary schools, with a focus on the breakdown of ethnicities across various campuses. Users can select multiple schools, view their enrollment figures, and analyze the distribution of students by ethnicity. The app also provides visualizations to help users better understand the data through bar charts and pie charts.

## Features

- **School Selection**: Users can select multiple schools from a list to compare.
- **Enrollment Visualization**: Bar chart showing the enrollment numbers for each selected school.
- **Ethnicity Breakdown**: Pie charts displaying the distribution of ethnicities for each selected school.
- **Ethnicity by Grade**: A comparative bar chart showing the breakdown of ethnicities by grade across selected schools.

## Dataset

The app uses a dataset that includes enrollment data for multiple elementary schools within a district. The data includes the following columns:

- **CAMPUS NAME**: The name of the school (campus).
- **ENROLLMENT**: The number of enrolled students at the school.
- **GRADE**: The grade levels for the students.
- **ETHNICITY**: The ethnicity of the students.

The dataset is pre-processed to handle missing or ambiguous values (e.g., replacing values like "<10" with a midpoint value).

### Dataset Source

The dataset used in this app is called `Enrollment Report_District_220905_Campuses_Grade_Ethnicity_2023-2024.csv`, and it contains detailed enrollment information for the 2023-2024 academic year.
